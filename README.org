* Prelude
I've LG540 mobile and it has GPS sensor that nobody knows how it
works. That's why I decided to write a simpliest application to find
the problem.

But I didn't found the problem and wrote this application.

Maybe later the application's source will be in the next project.

* About

This application gets all information from the GPS sensor from your
android mobile device and then prints them on the display.

There are 3 tabs that show 3 types of data: a location, a status of
satellites and logs.

For the logs CompactLog class is used that prints one line instead of
many lines with the same information. In the triangle brackets a
number how many the same events was occured.
